Google Cloud Vision API Python Samples
===============================================================================

This directory contains samples for Google Cloud Vision API. `Google Cloud Vision API`_ allows developers to easily integrate vision detection features within applications, including image labeling, face and landmark detection, optical character recognition (OCR), and tagging of explicit content


This sample demonstrates how to use the Cloud Vision API to do face detection.

Setup
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


Authentication
++++++++++++++

Authentication is typically done through `Application Default Credentials`_,
which means you do not have to change the code to authenticate as long as
your environment has credentials. You have a few options for setting up
authentication:

#. When running locally, use the `Google Cloud SDK`_

    .. code-block:: bash

        gcloud beta auth application-default login


#. When running on App Engine or Compute Engine, credentials are already
   set-up. However, you may need to configure your Compute Engine instance
   with `additional scopes`_.

#. You can create a `Service Account key file`_. This file can be used to
   authenticate to Google Cloud Platform services from any environment. To use
   the file, set the ``GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS`` environment variable to
   the path to the key file, for example:

    .. code-block:: bash

        export GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS=/path/to/service_account.json

.. _Application Default Credentials: https://cloud.google.com/docs/authentication#getting_credentials_for_server-centric_flow
.. _additional scopes: https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/authentication#using
.. _Service Account key file: https://developers.google.com/identity/protocols/OAuth2ServiceAccount#creatinganaccount

Install Dependencies
++++++++++++++++++++

#. Install `pip`_ and `virtualenv`_ if you do not already have them.

#. Create a virtualenv. Samples are compatible with Python 2.7 and 3.4+.

    .. code-block:: bash

        $ virtualenv env
        $ source env/bin/activate

#. Install the dependencies needed to run the samples.

    .. code-block:: bash

        $ pip install -r requirements.txt

.. _pip: https://pip.pypa.io/
.. _virtualenv: https://virtualenv.pypa.io/

Face detection
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++



To run this sample:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ python faces.py

    usage: faces.py [-h] [--out OUTPUT] [--max-results MAX_RESULTS] input_image
    
    Detects faces in the given image.
    
    positional arguments:
      input_image           the image you'd like to detect faces in.
    
    optional arguments:
      -h, --help            show this help message and exit
      --out OUTPUT          the name of the output file.
      --max-results MAX_RESULTS
                            the max results of face detection.
