"""Writes and reads a lightweight custom metric.

This is an example of how to use the Stackdriver Monitoring API to write
and read a lightweight custom metric. Lightweight custom metrics have no
labels and you do not need to create a metric descriptor for them.

Prerequisites: To run locally, download a Service Account JSON file from
your project and point GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS to the file.

From App Engine or a GCE instance with the correct scope, the Service
Account step is not required.

Typical usage: Run the following shell commands on the instance:

    python lightweight_custom_metric.py --project_id=<YOUR-PROJECT-ID>
