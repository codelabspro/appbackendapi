# Google App Engine Samples

This section contains samples for [Google App Engine](https://cloud.google.com/appengine). Most of these samples have associated documentation that is linked

2. Many samples require extra libraries to be installed. If there is a `requirements.txt`, you will need to install the dependencies with [`pip`](pip.readthedocs.org).

        pip install -t lib -r requirements.txt

3. Use `dev_appserver.py` to run the sample:

        dev_appserver.py app.yaml

Some samples may require additional setup. Refer to individual sample READMEs.
